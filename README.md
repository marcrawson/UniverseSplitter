# Universe Splitter
Universe Splitter on a budget.

Unfortunatley, the Universe Splitter app is paid.
However, this edition is free...
It may or may not emit a photon in Geneva.

Do you ever find yourself with decision fatigue after a hard day of work? Maybe even around lunch? Or maybe the minute you roll out of bed? If you answered yes, then Universe Splitter is for you! It's almost like flipping a coin but it's not.

I had a lot of fun making this, it's my first time using Python's "time" library. Algorithms are often optimized to take as little time as possible, however, in this case I found it beneficial (and more realistic) to add time delays between print statements to build suspence and to mimic the official Universe Splitter application.

Enjoy! <3
