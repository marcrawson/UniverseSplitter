# Universe Splitter
Budget version of the real Universe Splitter.

Unfortunatley, the Universe Splitter app is paid.
However, you may have this edition for free...
It may or may not emit a photon.

Do you ever find yourself with decision fatigue after a hard day's work? Maybe even around lunchtime? Or maybe the minute you roll out of bed? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then Universe Splitter is for you! It's almost like flipping a coin when you don't have a coin to flip.

I had a lot of fun making this one, it's my first time using the Python "time" library. Algorithms are often optimized to take as little time as possible, however, in this case I found it beneficial (and more realistic) to add time delays between print statements to build suspence and to mimic the official Universe Splitter application.

Enjoy!
