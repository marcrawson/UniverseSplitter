# Universe Splitter

Unfortunatley, the Universe Splitter app is $2.79. However, this version is free... *It may or may not emit a photon in Geneva*.

### Thought experiment
Do you ever find yourself with decision fatigue after a hard day of work? Maybe even around lunch? Or maybe the minute you roll out of bed? If you answered yes, then *Universe Splitter* is for you! It's almost like flipping a coin but it's not.

### Full functionality

### Background
I had a lot of fun making this, it's my first time using Python's "time" library. Algorithms are often optimized to take as little time as possible, however, in this case I found it beneficial (and more realistic) to add time delays between print statements to build suspence and to mimic the official Universe Splitter application.

### Enjoy!
